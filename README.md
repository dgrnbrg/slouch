# slouch

Simple Clojure RPC over HTTP

Heavily inspired by [slacker](http://github.com/sunng87/slacker), but using:

- nippy (https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy)
- http.async.client (https://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client)
- ring (https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring)

## usage

```clojure
; server
(require '[slouch.server]
         '[slouch.example.api])
(def ring-app
 (slouch.server/handler 'slouch.example.api))

; client
(require '[slouch.client])
(def c (slouch.client/new-client "http://localhost:3000"))
(defn-remote c sum :remote-ns 'slouch.example.api)
(sum 1 2 3)
; 6
```

## interceptors

Interceptors are just Ring middleware functions that are injected
into the slouch server pipeline.

For example, to record processing time for the entire pipeline:

```clojure
(defn wrap-processing-time [handler]
  (fn [request]
      (let [start (System/currentTimeMillis)
            response (handler request)
            finish (System/currentTimeMillis)
            duration (- finish start)]
        (log/info :ProcessingTime duration)
        response)))

(def ring-app
  (slouch.server/handler
    'slouch.example.api :interceptors {:alpha wrap-processing-time}))
```

There are three injection points for interceptors in the slouch
server pipeline.

:alpha - wraps the entire pipeline
:beta  - after deserialization of the incoming request body,
         before serialization of the outgoing response body
:gamma - after looking up the slouch function name in the
         incoming request URI, before function execution.

See the [Ring documentation](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts) to learn more about middleware.

Use clojure.core/comp to compose multiple interceptors for
injection at a single point.
